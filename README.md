   cd ss-activewear-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Edit `.env` and add your credentials:
   ```env
   SS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER=your_account_number
   SS_API_KEY=your_api_key
   SS_REGION=US  # or CA for Canada
   ```

## Usage with Claude Desktop

### Single Region Setup

1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the S&S Activewear MCP server configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "ss-activewear": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/ss-activewear-mcp/src/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "SS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER": "your_account_number",
           "SS_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
           "SS_REGION": "US"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restart Claude Desktop

## Canadian Configuration & Multi-Region Setup

### Important Notes for Canadian Users

- S&S Activewear maintains separate systems for US and Canadian operations
- You need separate account numbers and API keys for each region
- Canadian API endpoint: `https://api-ca.ssactivewear.com/V2`
- To get a Canadian API key, email: `api-ca@ssactivewear.com`

### Setting Up Both US and Canadian Regions

If you operate in both the US and Canada, you can set up two instances of the MCP server in your Claude Desktop configuration. Each instance will use the same codebase but with different credentials and regions.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ss-activewear-us": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/ss-activewear-mcp/src/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER": "your_us_account_number",
        "SS_API_KEY": "your_us_api_key",
        "SS_REGION": "US"
      }
    },
    "ss-activewear-ca": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/ss-activewear-mcp/src/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER": "your_canada_account_number",
        "SS_API_KEY": "your_canada_api_key",
        "SS_REGION": "CA"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With this setup:
- Both regions will be available in Claude simultaneously
- You can search US inventory by prefixing with "using ss-activewear-us"
- You can search Canadian inventory by prefixing with "using ss-activewear-ca"
- The same codebase handles both regions automatically based on the `SS_REGION` setting

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication errors
